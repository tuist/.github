Tuist is a virtual platform team for Swift app devs who ship. Through an integrated platform that integrates with your toolchain and projects, we help you stay focused and productive while building apps.

The following solutions are part of Tuist:

- [🗂️ **Generated projects**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/projects): A solution for more accessible and easier-to-manage Xcode projects.
- [🚝 **Cache**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/cache): Speed up builds across environments with a content-addressable store.
- [✅ **Selective testing**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/selective-testing): Run tests faster by selecting them based on the file changes.
- [📦 **Registry**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/registry): Speed up the resolution of [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/)-indexed packages.
- [📈 **Insights**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/insights): Get actionable insights from your projects, builds, and test runs to make informed decisions.
- [📱 **Bundle analysis**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/bundle-size): Analyze your built apps and get suggestions to improve them.

Openness and community are cornerstones in shaping Tuist, as we believe they are the key to building the best solution. We recommend checking out the following resources:

- [💬 **Community forum**](https://community.tuist.dev)


> [!NOTE]
> Even though our current focus is on the development phase of Apple native apps, we'll gradually expand our focus to include other ecosystems (e.g., Android, RN, and Flutter), and expand beyond just development.
